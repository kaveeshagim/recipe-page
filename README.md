## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot of spacing, padding, margining and especially list styling

Some css im proud of :

```css
.prep-card ul,
.ingredients ul,
.instructions ol {
  transform: translateX(3%);
  color: var(--stone-600);
  list-style-position: outside; /* Keep the bullets outside the text */
  padding-left: 0;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to further improve my responsive design and more with the layouting and element positioning. For future enhancements of this design, i want to build a recipe website with more recipe cards similar to this template

### Useful resources

- [Variable_Fonts_Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/Variable_Fonts_Guide) - This resource helped me get an idea about static fonts and variable fonts and how to use them
